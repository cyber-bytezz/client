Logical link control (LLC) layer –responsible for identifying and encapsulating network layer protocols and controls error checking and frame synchronization.\n\n3)Network layer: The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring packets from one node to another connected in \"different networks\".\n\n4)Transport layer: The transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source host to a destination host from one application to another across a network, while maintaining the quality-of-service functions. Transport protocols may be connection-oriented or connectionless.\n\n5)Session layer: Session Layer is the layer of the ISO Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model that controls the dialogues (connections) between computers.
